Data model used for communication between modules of the L2TOR system.

Directory /datamodel/ contains the conceptual data model that we intend to convert the CSV scenario into (we use the free program yEd Graph Editor)

Directory /converter/ contains the script that converts CSV into a format readable by modules

Directory /scenario/ contains the latest version of the CSV scenario

Directory /generated/ contains output of the automatic transformation between scenario (CSV) and readable format by modules
